# GeoWiz

This repository contains the work I have done on geospatial data analysis and visualization.

### Setup

Install requirements: pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Create folder for storing temporary files and cached data: mkdir ~/geowiz. If you want to put the folder somewhere else, you can edit lib/config.py
